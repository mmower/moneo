#  Moneo

An Objective-C template parsing and rendering framework.

## Motivation

Moneo exists for four reasons

* I was using existing Mustache libraries however they were either not well maintained, not Objective-C friendly, or both.
* Mustache contains a number of features that did not make sense in my context and created possible edge-cases I didn't want to have to deal with.
* I needed to know what expressions are being used in a template and none of the Mustache processors provided easy access to that meaning I was going to have to hack them or write my own parser to pull that info out.
* I'm rendering a lot of smallish templates very often, I need it as fast as possible. Moneo uses a Ragel generated parser and converts templates into a bytecode with a tiny VM for rendering. In future it will use `tcc` to dynamically generate rendering code.

## Important

Moneo is a work in progress. It's on Github because I wanted to check that I could include it in my app, Mentat, using Carthage. Template parsing is mostly complete but rendering is not included yet. If you're interested please follow along but there's nothing you could use right now.

## Installation

I use Carthage and Moneo should be very simple to install by adding to your Cartfile and using `cathage update`. I'm building on macOS I've no reason to suppose the the current version of Moneo wouldn't work on iOS but I haven't tried it.

## Usage

~~~~
#import <Moneo/Moneo.h>

- (NSSting *)renderEmail {
  MoneoParser *parser = [[MoneoParser alloc] init];

  MoneoTemplate *template = [parse parse:@"<p>{{=email}}</p>"];
  NSString *output = template.render( @{"email":@"matt@theartofnavigation.co.uk"} );
}

## Template Syntax

If you are familiar with Mustache, Moneo will hold no suprises. I changed the sigils slightly to make more sense to me but conceptually it's pretty simple.

### Evaluate

To evaluate a value use `{{=<keypath>}}` where `<keypath>` is a key in the context.

Example:

~~~~
{{=<keypath>}}
~~~~

### Iterate

Iterate determines whether a key has a value or not. If it does it treats a single value as a 1-element list. It then iterates the list interpreting everything up to the enclosing `{{/}}` for each value of the list.

Example:

~~~~
{{@<keypath>}}
Something something
{{/}}
~~~~

### Missing

Missing determines whether a key has a value or not. If it does it emits nothing, otherwise it evaluates everything up to the enclosing `{{/}}`.

Example:

~~~~
{{!<keypath>}}
something something
{{/}}
~~~~

And that's it. There is no support for including other templates, reading templates from files, etcâ€¦

## Contexts

Rendering happens in a context. This is passed to the `render` method of the `MoneoTemplate`.
